nutshell: A goal is a goal, and a roll is a roll. If I don't set no goals, then I don't eat no rolls.

Not only is it a new year, but it's a fresh start for me. I just graduated college with my Computer Science degree and I don't have a job. Since I don't have any other obligations at the moment, I need to stay busy. The best way to stay busy is to set some goals! 

<!-- summary -->
# SMART to the rescue!
**S**pecific **M**easurable **A**chievable **R**elevant **T**ime-bound

I first learned about the SMART goal while working as a supervisor at Costco. When writing employee performance reviews, I had to come up with SMART goals for them. Unless it was someone with outstanding or perfect attendance, these were the low-hanging fruit that I put on almost every performance review:

1. Reduce tardies by 50% by next review
2. Reduce absenses by 25% by next review

Yes, they're pretty basic. Most employees had some other goals to work toward, but what else are you supposed to say to a cashier that has been doing the same thing for 25+ years? At any rate, these are just examples of basic smart goals to illustrate what i'm going for here. They check all the SMART boxes.

## Goal 1: Get a job

Yep, this is the obvious one. The whole point of going back to school was to get into a new line of work that I find fulfilling. Currently the job market for almost anything other than labor is *competitive*, to say the least. As a result, I can't fully expect that i'll get a job in my field. So my goal isn't "Get a Software Engineering job", it's just "Get a job". I'll work toward the perfect outcome, but I'm going to incorporate some kind of circuit breaker in which I get *some* job by the end of the year. I'll have to break this one down into some sub-goals.

### Daily
1. Solve 2 LeetCode problems.
2. Send out a *quality* job applications. (not LinkedIn Easy Apply)
3. Review Computer Science "trivia". 

### Monthly
1. Complete a (programming) project.
2. something

### By August
In school I took a class on cloud security. The professor said we'd covered almost everything needed to pass the [AWS Cloud Security](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-security-specialty/?pp=cert&c=exam&z=4) test. So I'd like to have that one in the bag by sometime in the second half of the year.

## Goal 2: Run a marathon
This one is a doozy. I am going to do the [GOAT run](https://peninsulaadventuresports.com/events/goat-run/) in Port Angeles, Wa this September. Not only is this a marathon, but it's a decidedly difficult marathon with 3500ft of elevation gain! So not only will I be ramping mileage throughout the year, I'll need to steadily add elevation as well. Luckily hills aren't in short supply in the PNW.

There is a lot to this one, so i'll have to do a post on my training plan itself. However, for now, i'll be running 3-4 times a week with a 10% mileage increase. This will get refined more later so I know what my distance and elevation milestones need to be for each month leading up to the marathon.

## Goal 3: Build an ADU
We've been talking a lot lately about building another house in our backyard for my mother in-law to live in long term. Short term we're thinking we might move into it and rent our main house out since this place is a little big for my wife and I.

ADU stands for *Accessory Dwelling Unit* and is sometimes something that people build into their basements. Ours will be it's own house, so it's a *Detached ADU*. I've got a lot to figure out on this, but here is my rough timeline for now.

### February
Meet with the planning department and nail down my permitting costs and get the ball rolling.
### March
Get some bids for dirt work and the foundation.

### June
Hopefully have the foundation in and services run.

### September
My dad, uncle and brother have shown some interest in visiting and helping with framing. So by the end of September, before the rain starts again, i'd like to have the frame up and the house dried in.

### December
Maybe not move-in ready by the end of the year, but it should at least *look* like a house. We plan to do the bulk of the work ourselves, while hiring out a few things I'm not really going to bother wrapping my head around. Like site preperation, concrete, and drywall.
## Goal 4: Build an app that works
I've got a lot of ideas, and several false starts. My goal for this year is to see one of my ideas through to a minimum viable product. 

By the end of **January**, figure out which idea to run with first.
Spend the first week of **February** planning, designing and choose the tech stack I want to go with.
I should have the first MVP done by the end of **March**.

At this point i'll decide if I want to keep going on this app or start something else. I've got a lot to learn, and I know how to start a new project really well. Finishing (whatever you call "finished") a project is my biggest struggle. 

## Goal 5: Write every day
A daily journal plus my weekly blog post should make this one a slam dunk. This one is simple. Though I believe it'll be fulfilling. Not all goals have to be difficult.
