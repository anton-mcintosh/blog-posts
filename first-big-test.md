Well, the time has come. I think I've got everything working for my semi-automated blog pipeline. This post serves as a comprehensive test of the pipeline's functionality. If everything goes to plan, i'll follow this post up with an overview of my blog pipeline. Since I built it from scratch, I feel it's worth sharing. 

In the body of this post you're going to find a bunch of markdown testing. It's not really worth reading, so keep that in mind. I'm just trying to shake things down and make sure most things are looking halfway decent. A lot is still going to change, like colors and format, but for the most part things  are the way they need to be.

<!-- summary -->
# Markdown Tests
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4

Here is a **bulleted**  list:
* Pretty
* Engaging
* Now
* Isn't
* Summary

And here is an *ordered*  list:
1. yep
2. it
3. works

I think that should do it for the test. This covers most of what i think I may want to include in blog posts. If all this works correctly, then it's likely that the rest of the markdown stuff I might want to use will also work.

Here we go!!
