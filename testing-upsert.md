Here is where a summary will live. This is just going to be one or two paragraphs that lead the reader into the article. This is also what will display in the preview of the blog post on the main blogs page.

There might be multiple paragraphs in the summary. At this point, i'm not 100% sure how I want to differentiate the summary from the rest of the article. The challenge is that I need a reliable queue to parse to in the backend code. For now, I suppose i'll just use a series of characters as a line to separate the summary from the rest of the post.
